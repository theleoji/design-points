import Example from '../../src/templates/example.js'

These rules govern the gathering and management of user information onboarding and offboarding process for users.

## General instructions

Gather as little user information as is absolutely necessary for your service to function.

## Specific Instructions

### The ask when required rule

You should ask for user information no sooner than when it is absolutely required.

<Example>
  Service A is a food delivery service where users can select from a range of
  restaurants via a smartphone application. A‘s app asks for a ZIP code during
  the initial sign-up process to display nearby restaurants, and only asks for
  the user’s specific address when the first order is placed. A is in compliance
  with this rule.
</Example>

#### Exceptions

##### The more value added exception

You may ask for information earlier than is absolutely required, if:

1. The collection of such information is optional,
2. The collection of such information provides significant additional value to the user, and
3. The purposes of such information collection is clearly communicated to the user.

An information collection action does not add value simply because it saves such information for later use. An information collection action does not qualify for this exception if it is solely collected to provide such additional but unnecessary value. See the minimum necessity rule, below.

<Example>
  Service B, also a food delivery service, allows users to optionally provide
  their delivery address during the initial sign-up flow so they can find
  opportunities to reduce delivery fees by pairing the delivery with another
  customer’s. This is communicated clearly on the screen with an obvious option
  to skip. B is in compliance with this exception.
  <br />
  <br />
  If B does not communicate this value or allow users to skip such information collection
  at this stage, B is in violation of this exception and of the rule.
</Example>

### The minimum necessity rule

You should ask for only as much user information as is necessary to perform the function or task.

### The minimum validation rule

Information collected should be of the general form most acceptable to all users while retaining sufficient particularity for the purposes of collection. Names, places, addresses, contact information and other freeform text entries should not enforce a structed particularity or require compliance with any predetermined validation.

<Example>
  User P lives on a newly constructed street in a rapidly-growing metropolitan
  area. Service C, an online shopping service, uses a periodically-updated
  database of addresses to validate all input addresses. Because P’s street was
  not yet entered into the address database, C insists that P has entered her
  address incorrectly. C is not in compliance with this rule.
</Example>

#### Exceptions

##### The nonsensical data exception

Validation may be enforced to the extent necessary to prevent the collection of nonsensical data.

<Example>
  Service C, the online shopping service, uses validation to ensure that the
  entered text in a credit card number field is all numeric. As any non-numeric
  entries in a credit card number would be nonsensical, C’s case falls under
  this exception.
</Example>
